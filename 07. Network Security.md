# Management and Miantanence Network Security

## Purpose:
To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization's network infrastructure and data.

## Scope:
Applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors with network access.

## Responsibilities:

#### Network Administrator:

Design, implement, and maintain network security measures.
Monitor network traffic and security logs.
Install security patches and conduct vulnerability assessments.

#### IT Department:

Assist in implementing security measures.
Manage firewall rules and network performance.
Respond to and investigate security incidents.

#### Employees:

Adhere to network security policies.
Use strong passwords and report suspicious activities.
Procedures:

#### Firewalls:

Implement and update firewall rules.
Allow necessary services and ports.

#### Access Control:

Enforce strict access control policies.
Implement authentication mechanisms.

#### Network Monitoring:

Deploy monitoring tools.
Set up intrusion detection systems.

#### Vulnerability Management:

Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.
Prioritize and apply security patches.

#### Security Awareness and Training:

Conduct regular training sessions.
Raise awareness about common threats.

#### Incident Response:

Establish reporting and response process.
Investigate, mitigate, and learn from incidents.

## Prerequisites:

Access to network infrastructure and security management tools.
Knowledge of network security best practices, protocols, and technologies.
Understanding of the organization's network architecture and assets.

## Procedures:

#### Network Security Assessment:
     1. The IT Department will conduct regular risk assessments to identify network security vulnerabilities.
     2. Vulnerability scanning tools and techniques will be used to assess the security posture of network devices and systems.
     3. Identified vulnerabilities will be prioritized based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

#### Network Security Design and Implementation:
     1. Network Administrators will design and implement appropriate security controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls, based on the organization's security policies and risk assessments.
     2. Segmentation and isolation techniques will be employed to protect critical network resources and limit unauthorized access.
     3. Virtual private networks (VPNs) will be deployed to secure remote access to the network.

#### Monitoring and Incident Response:
     1. Network traffic will be continuously monitored using intrusion detection and prevention systems, log analysis tools, and network monitoring software.
     2. Security incidents, anomalies, and breaches will be identified, investigated, and responded to promptly.
     3. Incident response plans will be followed to contain, mitigate, and recover from network security incidents.
     4. Lessons learned from security incidents will be incorporated into future network security improvements.

#### Security Awareness and Training:
     1. The IT Department will provide regular training and awareness programs to educate employees and stakeholders about network security best practices, policies, and procedures.
     2. Phishing simulations, security bulletins, and other awareness initiatives will be used to promote a security-conscious culture within the organization.
