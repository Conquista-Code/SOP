Coordinate with relevant stakeholders for OS version upgrades.
Develop and maintain a central repository for OS version control.
Communicate and enforce OS version control policies and procedures.

#### System Administrators:

Identify the need for OS version updates based on security, performance, and compatibility considerations.
Conduct thorough testing of new OS versions in a controlled environment.
Coordinate with application owners to ensure compatibility with new OS versions.
Implement approved OS version updates following established procedures.
Monitor and resolve any issues arising from OS version updates.

## Prerequisites:

Access to the central repository for OS version control.
Knowledge of the organization's IT infrastructure and dependencies.
Understanding of the impact of OS version changes on existing applications and systems.

     3. Recommendations for OS version updates will be communicated to the relevant stakeholders.

#### Testing and Validation:
     1. System Administrators will set up a controlled testing environment to evaluate new OS versions.
     2. Compatibility testing with existing applications and systems will be performed.
     3. Security and performance testing will be conducted to ensure the stability and reliability of the new OS version.
     4. System Administrators will document the testing results and provide recommendations.

#### Approval and Implementation:
     1. The IT Department will review the testing results and make a decision regarding the implementation of the new OS version.
     2. If approved, the IT Department will coordinate with System Administrators and application owners to schedule the implementation.
     3. A rollback plan will be established to revert to the previous OS version in case of unforeseen issues during the implementation.

#### Documentation and Communication:
     1. The IT Department will maintain a central repository for documenting OS version control information, including the current and previous versions.
     2. Changes to the OS version will be properly documented, including reasons for the update, testing results, and implementation details.
